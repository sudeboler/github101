    "Your third task is to formulate the problem for the game **Connnect 4**. Connect 4 is a game in which “the players choose a color and then take turns dropping colored discs into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs.” Modify the TicTacToe problem definition code to implement Connect 4. Solve Connect 4 for two players where one player uses minimax or alpha-beta pruning and the other player uses random search.\n",

You must also  update `actions` function because in Connect 4, we can only play to the lowest empty row in each column."
